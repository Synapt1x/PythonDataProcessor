# Some notes from meeting with Dr. Kelly and Kevin

Counterbalanced -- If failed, then that goes to back of order
	-- One thing that we need to look for are these fails, when they are pushed
	back to the back of the list (see how many repeats are in the list)
input file defining groups -- setup.txt (e.g., geometry-first  vs. feature-first)
output vector -- separate by group (defined by goal indices)
(x,y) --> relative to goal anyway
keep all pecks -- each quadrant can become a theoretical goal (extrapolated
from known goal position)
